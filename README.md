Electrocatalytic integration framework

In this work, we combined the DFT calculations with the machine learning 
method to screen the potential 2D MXenes OBAs and reveal the dominant 
factors that render the 2D MXenes OBAs with efficient HER performances.

Based on the Sabatier principle, 
 we carried out high throughput DFT calculations to select 77 types of
  ideal HER catalysts that might be synthesized from the database of 377 
  types of stabled O atom termination 2D MXenes OBAs. Machine learning 
  reveals the bond length (dM-O) of oxygen and surface metal atom,
   the distance between nearest neighbor O atoms (dO-O), the ionization
    energy difference (IEMd) and the average value of affinity energy
     (EAMm) of the alloy elements, and the valence electrons (Xv) of X = C 
     or N correspond to the HER catalytic activity of 2D MXenes OBAs. 
     Finally, electronic structure study provides an explanation to the 
     proposed machine learning descriptors.
